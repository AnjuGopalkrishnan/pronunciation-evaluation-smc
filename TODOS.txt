TODOS:

* read through the artic dataset readme
* remove anju's code
* put lalitha's code in a better manner in a separate files
* look into how to do evaluation
* First go through existing source code and preprocessing steps in anju's branch
* Put the code from lalitha's drive into this and analyse it -> https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gBfiHr9J96ZIOuh8JvGGwO-6oyt4W2vn
    - she mentioned that all of the datafiles were already preprocessed have to check that
* Look at hugging face to see what is there in terms of whisper + speech brain
* get started on fine tune on whisper in colab pro
* look at the lip animation thing
* Define a function which can take in a sentence as input and predicted sentence and tell the phonemes which need to be replaced


NOTES:

schedulers not added
